#### Ladybug Tools CRUD API

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ladybug-tools/ladybug-tools-api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ladybug-tools/ladybug-tools-api)


### Terminal commands

To run test:
```bash
python manage.py test
```
To setup the database tables. You only need to run `init` once but have to migrate and upgrade your database anytime you make changes to the SqlAlchemy models:
```bash
python manage.py db init
python manage.py db migrate
python manage.py db upgrade
```
To run application (after setting up the database tables):
```bash
python manage.py run
```

### Viewing the app ###

    Open the following url on your browser to view swagger documentation
    http://127.0.0.1:5000/


### Using Postman ####

    Authorization header is in the following format:

    Key: Authorization
    Value: "token_generated_during_login"

    For testing authorization, url for getting all user requires an admin token while url for getting a single
    user by public_id requires just a regular authentication.

### Local Development
A PostgreSQL database is required in order to develop this project locally. More detailed instructions will be added soon on how to set up the database locally and ensuring it is setup in a way that will play nicely with the testing configuration.

#### Virtual Environment Setup
In order to not mix up your python environments and have clashing dependencies when developing for this project it is strongly recommended that you use virtual environments. Here are the steps to set up a local python virtual environment for this repository:
1. Make sure you have python 3.6 installed (this project has not been tested on python 2.7). You can do this by typing:
```cmd
C:\Users\username> python --version
Python 3.6
```
Note: Sometimes python 3 is accessed by using `python3 --version`
```cmd
C:\Users\username> python --version
Python 2.7
C:\Users\username> python3 --version
Python 3.6
```
2. Install the virtualenv package:
```cmd
C:\Users\username> pip install virtualenv
```

3. Create a virtual environment in this repository. Ensure you are running the following commands at the root of this repository.
```cmd
C:\Users\username>  cd C:\path\to\this\repository
C:\path\to\this\repository > virtualenv venv
```
There should now be a new folder within this repository called `venv`. Feel free to rename it as you please, venv is just commonly used.

4. Activate the virtual environment and install the project dependencies. You will know activation of environment has worked if you see `(venv)` at each terminal entry. If you are using the standard cmd terminal run the following command:
```cmd
C:\path\to\this\repository > venv\Scripts\activate
(venv) C:\path\to\this\repository > pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If you are using git bash on windows or using a UNIX shell (Linux/Mac) run the following command to activate the virtual environment:
```bash
username@DESKTOP-NAME: ~/path/to/repository$ source venv/Scripts/activate
(venv) username@DESKTOP-NAME: ~/path/to/repository$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### PostgreSQL Setup
The Ladybug objects api uses PostgreSQL as a backend database to store all the objects sent to the API. Such a database must be installed locally for development and testing.
1. Install PostgeSQL.
  * **WINDOWS** To install PostgreSQL on windows you can follow the instructions from their webpage [here](http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/install-postgresql/). Use whatever username and password you like when creating the superuser account, we will be creating another user specifically for API development afterwards.

  * **LINUX** To install PostgreSQL on linux you can follow the [Digital Ocean guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-postgresql-on-ubuntu-18-04) (this works for Ubuntu but might not work for other distros).
  * **MAC OS** To install PostgreSQL on MacOS you can follow [this guide](https://medium.com/@Umesh_Kafle/postgresql-and-postgis-installation-in-mac-os-87fa98a6814d).


2. Login to your local PostgreSQL database using the `psql` command line tool. Once the installation has completed open a new terminal window and login to your Postgres server by typing `psql -U postgres` (postgres is the default admin user, you might be prompted for the password you set during the installation process).
**Windows CMD**
```cmd
C:\Users\username> psql -U postgres
psql (10.5)
WARNING: Console code page (850) differs from Windows code page (1252) 8-bit characters might not work correctly. See psql reference page "Notes for Windows users" for details.
Type "help" for help.
postgres=#
```
**UNIX Shell**
```bash
username@DESKTOP-NAME: ~$ psql -U postgres
psql (10.5)
Type "help" for help.
postgres=#
```
3. Create the `ladybug` user. Once logged into `psql` create the user `ladybug` with the password `supersecretpassword` (you can change this if you want, just be sure to also change value of `PGPASS` accordingly in the `.env` file in the root of this project). To do so we run the following command `create user ladybug with password 'supersecretpassword';` (don't forget the `;`!).
```cmd
postgres=# create user ladybug with password 'supersecretpassword';
CREATE ROLE      
```

4. Create the development and testing databases on your local PostgreSQL server. Two databases are required for local development, a development database to build and experiment with new tables etc... and a testing database to run unit tests on. While still logged into `psql` create the development database `ladybugtools` using `create database ladybugtools;`. Then connect to the database using `\c ladybugtools` and add the `uuid-ossp` extension (a utility to generate UUIDs) by using `create extension if not exists "uuid-ossp";`
```cmd
postgres=# create database ladybugtools;
CREATE DATABASE
postgres=# \c ladybugtools
You are now connected to database "ladybugtools" as user "postgres".
ladybugtools=# create extension if not exists "uuid-ossp";
CREATE EXTENSION
ladybugtools=#
```
Then run the same commands but for the `ladybugtools_test` testing database.
```cmd
ladybugtools=# create database ladybugtools_test;
CREATE DATABASE
ladybugtools=# \c ladybugtools_test
You are now connected to database "ladybugtools_test" as user "postgres".
ladybugtools_test=# create extension if not exists "uuid-ossp";
CREATE EXTENSION
ladybugtools_test=#
```
You can then quit the `psql` command line tool by typing `\q`:
```cmd
ladybugtools_test=# \q
```

I cannot thank [`cosmic-byte`](https://github.com/cosmic-byte) enough for their thorough article walking through how to build a
flask restplus api server. The repo forked for the basis of this project can be found below:
